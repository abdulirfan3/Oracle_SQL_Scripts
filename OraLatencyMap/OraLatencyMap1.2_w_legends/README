-- OraLatencyMap, a performance widget to visualize the latency drilldown for Oracle wait events using Heatmaps
--
-- Scope: Performance investigations of event latency. For example single block read latency with OraLatencyMap.sql
--
-- Author: Luca.Canali@cern.ch

-- Version: v1.2, March 2014. Original version 1.0, Aug 2013.

-- Credits: Brendan Gregg for "Visualizing System Latency", Communications of the ACM, July 2010
--          Tanel Poder (snapper, moats, sqlplus and color), Marcin Przepiorowski (topass)
--
-- Notes: These scripts need to be run from sqlplus from a terminal supporting ANSI escape codes. 
--        Run from a privileged user (select on v$event_histogram and execute on dbms_lock.sleep)
--        Tested on 11.2.0.3, 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.1 for Linux x86_64.
--        A workaround may be needed for 10g clients: 
--             increase set lines to 13000 in OraLatencyMap_advanced.sql (thanks to Paul Kelly).
--        Best not wrap sqlplus with rlwrap or else graphics smoothness will suffer.
--
-- How to start:
--      sqlplus / as sysdba
--      SQL> @OraLatencyMap 
--
-- More examples:
--      SQL> @Example2_commit_time.sql
--      SQL> @OraLatencyMap_advanced 5 "db file sequential read" 12 80 "and inst_id=1"

-- Output: Two latency heatmaps of the given wait event
--         The top heatmap represents the number of waits per second and per latency bucket
--         The bottom heatmap represents the estimated time waited per second and per latency bucket
--         with the advanced script it is possible to customize sampling time, event name, screen size 
--         moreover in RAC, the default is to aggregate histogram data over all nodes, but this is 
--         customizable too to display data only for a given instance and/or set of sessions

-- Related: OraLatencyMap_advanced.sql      -> this is the main script for generic investigation of event latency with heat maps
--          OraLatencyMap_internal.sql      -> the slave script where all the computation and visualization is done
--          OraLatencyMap_internal_loop.sql -> the slave script that runs several dozens of iterations of the tool's engine 
--          Example*.sql                    -> a series of wrapper and exmaple scripts

-- Change list: 
--          1.2  OraLatencyMap_internal: added legend, added average latency value, additional minor changes
--          1.1b OraLatencyMap_internal: fixed a small mistake in the formular to compute v_color  
--          1.1a OraLatencyMap_internal: use of ceil instead of round to compute g_table_wait_count rate. (thanks to Coskan)
--          1.1a OraLatencyMap_internal: Add print date and time. (thanks to Coskan)
--          1.1a OraLatencyMap_internal: minor, change of position for the code to compute g_latest_time_sec
